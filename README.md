# Kinect-RGB-and-Depth-Recorder
An OpenFrameworks implementation in C++ to record the video stream from the RGB and Depth channel of a Kinect v1 camera

# How to use
This is an OpenFrameworks implementation, so you will need OpenFrameworks alongside with the ofxKinect and ofxVideoRecorder plugins. 
Just put the project inside the apps folder and you're ready to go! 
All the recorded videos go to /bin/data
